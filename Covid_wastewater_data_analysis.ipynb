    "This data is valuable because it is anonymous and does not rely on individual reporting. It does not require a person to know they have the virus. Many people do not confirm their cases with a government reported test because they do not realize they have Covid19, or they take a rapid home test and do not use reporting tools on government websites, so their cases are not offically counted. This makes public health measures difficult for stakeholders to navigate. Wastewater data is valuable because  health officials can use this data to make decisions and request funding as well as plan for spikes in cases so that they can ready medical facilities for impending increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data collected is limited to watersheds managed by public officials, therefore locations, such as rural areas, that collect wastewater via septic tanks are not included in the dataset. Additionally, cities started their wastewater testing and collection at different times, so increases and decreases of Covid-19 levels are measured relative to the city's previous sample collection. **(Delete: The limitations of this data are...
