Many people do not confirm their cases with a government reported test because they do not realize they have Covid19, or they take a rapid home test and do not use reporting tools on government websites, so their cases are not offically counted. This makes public health measures difficult for stakeholders to navigate. Wastewater data is valuable because  health officials can use this data to make decisions and request funding as well as plan for spikes in cases so that they can ready medical facilities for impending increases. \n",
