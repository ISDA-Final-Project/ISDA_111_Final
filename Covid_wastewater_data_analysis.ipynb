    "# Report Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 has been a major public health crises for almost three years. With unpredictable surges in reported cases, public officials have resorted to establishing national predictive wastewater analysis to monitor SARS-CoV-2 levels present in wastewater treatment plants. \n",
    "\n",
    "As people use water for their daily needs (toilets, showers, sinks, etc), the SARS-CoV-2 virus sheds with the water used and is then draint to water treatmet plants. From there, wastewater samples are collected by CDC officials to test for virus levels present within the sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data is valuable because it is anonymous and does not rely on individual reporting. It does not require a person to know they have the virus. Many people do not confirm their cases with a government reported test because they do not realize they have Covid19, or they take a rapid home test and do not use reporting tools on government websites, so their cases are not offically counted. This makes public health measures difficult for stakeholders to navigate. Wastewater data is valuable because health officials can use this data to make decisions and request funding as well as plan for surges in cases so that they can ready medical facilities for impending increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data collected is limited to watersheds managed by public officials, therefore locations, such as rural areas, that collect wastewater via septic tanks are not included in the dataset. Additionally, cities started their wastewater testing and collection at different times, so increases and decreases of Covid-19 levels are measured relative to the same treatment facility's previous sample collection. This in turn means some facilities did not collect during January 2022 when record breaking surges in cases occurred nationally.\n",
